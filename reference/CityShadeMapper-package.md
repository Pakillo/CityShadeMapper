# CityShadeMapper: Generate High Resolution Shade Maps and Shaded Routes from Remote Sensing Data

CityShadeMapper can generate high resolution shade maps (e.g. for every
square meter and every hour of the year) for any city or town from open
remote sensing (LiDAR) data. CityShadeMapper can also return optimal
routes within any two points in the city that maximise the amount of
shade for pedestrians.
