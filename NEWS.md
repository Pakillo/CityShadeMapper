# CityShadeMapper 0.0.3

* Fixed bug with raster resolutions different to 1 meter (#17). Thanks @Jean-Romain

# CityShadeMapper 0.0.2

* Added new logical argument `low.veg.as.ground` to `rasterize_lidar_cover_class()` 
to decide if low vegetation should be considered ground or mixed with medium-high vegetation 
(#21).
